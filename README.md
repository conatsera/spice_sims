A collection of SPICE models and LTSpice symbols that I've made for general use and spectrography system design.

# SiPM
Modeled after a simple photodiode, no references were necessary.
# Power
Power rails models are typically based around the sample transient models provided by the manufactuer, but with components replaced with those that are/were available and redesigned for an altered output voltage.
